## Potential questions:
- [ ] After changing `ShellType` to being numeric, could it be a better response?
- [ ] Are there any clusters that could potentially provide any additional insight?
- [ ] Does the data contain an equal amount of `Type1` and `Type2` records?
- [ ] What could be a cause for corelation between the different variables?

## Data Exploration:

Observations:
- There is are no `NA` values
- There is a categorical variable with records that are either `Type1` or `Type2`.
- There are significantly more `Type2` than `Type1` shells. This could potentially cause the data to be biased towards `Type2` shell types regarding the variable `ShellType`.
- `Length` values range from 9.63 to 18.39, Q1 = 12.88 $\mu$ = 13.94, Median = 13.79, Q3 = 14.96

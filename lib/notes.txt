Potential questions:
    - After changing `ShellType` to being numeric, could it be a better response?
    - Are there any clusters that could potentially provide any additional insight?
    - Does the data contain an equal amount of `Type1` and `Type2` records?
    - What could be a cause for corelation between the different variables?
